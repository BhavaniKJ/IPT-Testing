Mild differences between the matlab and scilab
Scilab lets you have two sigma values, sigma x and sigma y while matlab has only one sigma value.
Matlab has padding feature, which scilab lacks.
Matlab has two functions: imgaussfilt() and imfilter(). 
imgaussfilt cannot be used as it only available for  Matlab R2015a.
