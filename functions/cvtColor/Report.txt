We used color.bmp, color.jpeg, color.png and color.tif.
The above 4 images are 16X16 RGB images.
Since there is problem with the way Scilab reads color.png, the conversion was not possible.
Rest of the images were tested out and the conversion was successfull.

There is a good possibility for the martrices not to match due to the following-:
The OpenCV Reference Manual, Release 2.4.10.0, Page 283: "Note that the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the bytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue component, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red."

It is to note that Scilab had two options, RGB and BGR conversion due to the above mentioned reason and Matlab only RGB conversion. Due to this reason BGR conversion cannot be validated or compared with matlab.
Similarly, Matlab did not have luv, HSL format as well and therefore these formats cannot compared with the results produced in Sclab
