16X16 Gray scale images of jpeg, bmp, png and tif format were used.
Scilab is able to 
	take colour image unlike matlab.
	enables two threshold values, apertureSize and gradient ulike matlab
Scilab does not 
	have parameters like: method,  direction and sigma.
	provide output parameters like threshout.

Matlab takes a genralised approach to edge detection and canny is one of them.
