16X16 color images of jpeg, bmp, png and tif format were used.
Scilab is able to 
	change the depth ksize , scale, delta of the image.
Matlab does not 
	elaborate laplacian filter the way scilab does.
	takes a genralised approach to filter and Laplace is one of them.
	uses the smw function for gaussian and sobel.
Matlab has an extra feature : alpha but should not add any advantage die to the elaborate nature scilab's laplace filter works

These two functions work differently and comparission is not appropriate.
