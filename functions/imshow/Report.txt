We used color.bmp, color.jpeg, color.png and color.tif.
The above 4 images are 16X16 RGB images.
Scilab was able to read all the formats and display them as well.
The exception was .png file. This because there was a problem while reading the file.
Matlab was unable to display tiff. Not sure this was due to graphics problem and a issue with matlab
