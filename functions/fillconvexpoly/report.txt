The function was tested on R2011 and thus insertShape(R2014) could not be used.

The following steps need to be implemented to draw a polygon. 
A_jpeg=im2double(imread('color.jpeg'));
hshapeins = vision.ShapeInserter;
Pts = [4 3 1 7;2 5 7 5]
B_jpeg= step(hshapeins,A_jpeg, Pts)

This version only lets me to draw a polygon and is much restricted when compared to insertShape.
Comparing with this function is not worth while.

Scilab has an extra features such as shift, while matlab's insertShape has opacity and smoothedges.

Had insertShape been used this would be the input.
points = [3 6 10 1 13 5 3 9 6 5 6 11];
B_jpeg = insertShape(A_jpeg, 'FilledPolygon', points, 'Color','black');


NOTE:: Scilab's documentation on fillconcexpoly is wrong, the code's comment misses on number of points.
